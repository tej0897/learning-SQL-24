SQL is the programming language used to communicate with our database.

What are databases?

    Databases are systems that allows us to store and organize data.
    They are useful when dealing with large amount of data.

            ******************

Spreadsheets Vs Databases

    Spreadsheets:
        one-time analysis
        quickly need to chart something
        reasonable dataset size

    Databases:
        Data Integrity (users not able to just click on a cell and change data)
        Handle massive amounts of data
        Quickly combine different datasets
        Automate steps for re-use
        can support data for websites and applications

            ******************

SELECT:
    Allows users to retrieve information from a table.

    Syntax:
    SELECT column_name
    FROM table_name

    Example:
    SELECT c1 FROM table_1
    SELECT c1, c2 FROM table_1  (multiple columns)
    SELECT * FROM table_1   (all the columns from the table - not recommended)

            ******************

SELECT DISTINCT
    Allows users to get the distinct values from the table.

    Syntax:
    SELECT DISTINCT column_name
    FROM table_name;

    Examples:

    SELECT DISTINCT release_year
    FROM film;
    or
    SELECT DISTINCT (release_year)
    FROM film;

    SELECT DISTINCT rental_rate
    FROM film;

            ******************

COUNT
    Returns number of input rows that match a specific condition of a query.
    We can pass COUNT on a specific column or just pass COUNT(*)
    parenthesis is needed, it will not work without it.

    Syntax:
    SELECT COUNT(column_name)
    FROM table_name;

    Example:
    SELECT COUNT(name)
    FROM table_1;

    How many unique names are there in a table:
    SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT (name))
    FROM table_1;

            ******************

SELECT WHERE:
    WHERE statement allows us to specify the conditions on columns to get the desired rows.

    Syntax:
    SELECT column_names
    FROM table_name
    WHERE conditions

    COMPARISON operators:
        compare a value with something:
            is price >= 3$
            is the pet name "sam"

    LOGICAL operators:
        Allows us to combine multiple comparison operators.
        AND, OR and NOT

    Example:
    1. get the name and age of people named "David"
    SELECT name, age
    FROM table_1
    WHERE name = 'David';

    2. get name and age of people named "David" who are at least 40 years old
    SELECT name, age
    FROM table_1
    Where name = 'David' AND age >= 40;
