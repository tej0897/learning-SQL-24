SQL is the programming language used to communicate with our database.

What are databases?

    Databases are systems that allows us to store and organize data.
    They are useful when dealing with large amount of data.

Spreadsheets Vs Databases

    Spreadsheets:
        one-time analysis
        quickly need to chart something
        reasonable dataset size

    Databases:
        Data Integrity (users not able to just click on a cell and change data)
        Handle massive amounts of data
        Quickly combine different datasets
        Automate steps for re-use
        can support data for websites and applications

            ******************

SELECT:
    Allows users to retrieve information from a table.

    Syntax:
    SELECT column_name
    FROM table_name

    Example:
    SELECT c1 FROM table_1
    SELECT c1, c2 FROM table_1  (multiple columns)
    SELECT * FROM table_1   (all the columns from the table - not recommended)
